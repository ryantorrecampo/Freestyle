# Freestyle

Freestyle is a website I made after my friends and I would use random word generators and YouTube instrumentals to freestyle to. It became a fun game to play, so I decided to incorporate both aspects into one web app.

- Developed with React/Redux
- Uses Axios to pull data from the Wordnik and YouTube API.
- The songs pulled are from a personal playlist of mine. Feel free to contribute to it here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLlJxAcQth2uTyofPvsINUO9pO-hRWNTe
- Currently looking to add different difficulties for the word banks
